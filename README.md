# Main-Project1
## Problem Statement:
Developing a functionality to connect a form to a database using PHP and MySQL, allowing users 
to submit and store student information, including attributes such as student name, student ID, 
course/program, department, contact number, email, date of birth, gender, parent/guardian name, 
academic year/semester, and GPA/grade point average. The form will utilize HTML for input fields 
and PHP for establishing the connection to the database.
## Description:
The objective is to create a form that enables users to enter student details and submit them for 
storage in a MySQL database. The form will include input fields for attributes such as student 
name, student ID, course/program, department, contact number, email, date of birth, gender, 
parent/guardian name, academic year/semester, and GPA/grade point average. Upon submission, 
the PHP script will validate the input data and establish a connection with the MySQL database to 
store the information securely.
The HTML form will be designed to capture the applicant details, utilizing appropriate input field 
types (text, select, date, etc.) to ensure accurate data entry. The PHP script will handle form 
submission, validate the input for completeness and correctness, and establish a connection with 
the MySQL database.
## key Requirements:
1. Design an HTML form with input fields for attributes like student name, student ID, 
course/program, department, contact number, email etc as mentioned above
2. Utilize appropriate HTML input field types and attributes for each attribute, ensuring data 
integrity and usability.
3. Implement PHP code to validate the form inputs, checking for completeness and correctness 
before proceeding.
4. Establish a connection to the MySQL database using PHP and appropriate database credentials.
5. Create a table in the MySQL database to store the applicant information, defining the appropriate 
columns and data types.
6. Insert the validated applicant data into the MySQL database table upon successful 
form submission
